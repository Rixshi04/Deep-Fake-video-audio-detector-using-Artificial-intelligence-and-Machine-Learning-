# Deep-Fake-video-audio-detector-using-Artificial-intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-

ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project focuses on detecting deepfake videos and audio clips using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Deepfakes are synthetic media generated using deep learning models, capable of mimicking real peopleâ€™s voices and appearances with high accuracy. This system aims to identify such manipulations and flag potentially fake content to ensure media authenticity and digital trust.
