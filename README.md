# Deep-Fake-video-audio-detector-using-Artificial-intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-

📘 Overview

This project focuses on detecting deepfake videos and audio clips using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Deepfakes are synthetic media generated using deep learning models, capable of mimicking real people’s voices and appearances with high accuracy. This system aims to identify such manipulations and flag potentially fake content to ensure media authenticity and digital trust.

🚀 Key Features

🎥 Video Deepfake Detection – Identifies manipulated or synthetically generated video frames using CNN and LSTM hybrid models.

🔊 Audio Deepfake Detection – Detects synthetic speech generated by AI-based voice cloning.

🧩 Hybrid Deep Learning Framework – Combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for spatial analysis and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal dependencies.

📊 Explainable AI Reports – Provides detection confidence scores and visualization of manipulated regions.

⚙️ Real-time Processing (Optional) – Can be extended for live streaming content verification.

🏗️ System Components
Component	Description
Video Processing Module	Extracts frames, normalizes data, and detects facial landmarks.
Audio Processing Module	Converts audio to spectrograms and extracts voice embeddings.
Model Training	Trains CNN-LSTM hybrid model on labeled datasets (e.g., FaceForensics++, ASVspoof).
